# Random-Password-Generator
A random password generator is software program or 
hardware device that takes input from a random or 
pseudo-random number generator and automatically 
generates a password. Random passwords can be 
generated manually, using simple sources of randomness 
such as dice or coins, or they can be generated using a 
computer.
This random password generator is built around lexical 
analysis using python where we are converting characters 
into tokens and concatenating them to make a random 
password for the user.
